# Find Next Prime

The repository is a simple project that produces a utility class NextPrime that has two static methods:-
isPrime(n) -> determines if the provided n is a Prime Number
nextPrime(n) -> find the next Prime Number after the provided n

The isPrime uses the simple [Primality Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test) algorithm.
